# countdownApp
This app is built in a vue framework using NUXT.JS, for documentation please see the last line of this document. 
If you are using a mac, simply download the project and type "npm run dev" and got to localhost:3000 in your browser window. 
Be sure you have NPX installed (macs typically come with this installed). If you do not, then run this command "npm install -g npx". 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
